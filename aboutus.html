<p><b>Interesting Facts About Oragami Art</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><i> Origami (折り紙, Japanese pronunciation: [oɾiɡami] or [oɾiꜜɡami] </i></li>
    <li><i> ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku)</i></li>
    <li><i> It is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.</i></li>
    <li><i>There are seven types of origami arts </i></li>
    <li><i> 1. Action origami includes origami that flies, requires inflation to complete, or, when complete, uses the kinetic energy of a person's hands, applied at a certain region on the model, to move another flap or limb.</i></li>
    <li><i> 2. Modular origami consists of putting a number of identical pieces together to form a complete model. Often the individual pieces are simple, but the final assembly may be more difficult.</i></li>
    <li><i> 3. Wet-folding is an origami technique for producing models with gentle curves rather than geometric straight folds and flat surfaces. The paper is dampened so it can be moulded easily, the final model keeps its shape when it dries.</i></li>
    <li><i> 4. Origami tessellation is a branch that has grown in popularity after 2000. A tessellation is a collection of figures filling a plane with no gaps or overlaps. In origami tessellations, pleats are used to connect molecules such as twist folds together in a repeating fashion.</i></li>
    <li><i> 5. Kirigami is a Japanese term for paper cutting. Cutting was often used in traditional Japanese origami, but modern innovations in technique have made the use of cuts unnecessary.</i></li>
    <li><i> 6. Pureland origami adds the restrictions that only simple mountain/valley folds may be used, and all folds must have straightforward locations. It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills.</i></li>
    <li><i> 7. Strip folding is a combination of paper folding and paper weaving.[15] A common example of strip folding is called the Lucky Star, also called Chinese lucky star, dream star, wishing star, or simply origami star.</i></li>
